geoparse
========

Parsing various formats of lat/long and UTM coordinates, and conversion between the two.


I hearby put this code in the public domain.  Use it and abuse it as you like.  
Referencing it is optional, but a nice gesture.

It would make my effort feel less wasted if you sent me a quick note telling me that
you could use my code for something else. :)

And if you feel like improving it, it is all available on:
	https://github.com/vbakke/geoparse.git


The project can be seen on:
